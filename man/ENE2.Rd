\title{Estimate Excess Number of Events in Treatment Group With Condition-Specific Exposure}
\usage{
ENE2(
  file,
  reg.model = c("poisson", "NB"),
  wt.type = "treat",
  save = TRUE,
  save.plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to an Excel file containing the data. The file must contain multiple sheets with the following sheet naming convention: YYYY_Control_BD containing data for control population in year YYYY and YYYY_Treat_BD containing data for population under treatment. On top of these, the file must also contain the matching exposure that will act as denominator in the regression model. The naming format for these sheets containing exposures are YYYY_Control_AD and YYYY_Treat_AD. Inside each sheet, the condition name/ID must be specified in the first column and the first row contains variable names. Each row contains data for a condition across different agegroups (from column 2 onwards) with the last row contains the population size to be used as offset in the regression model.}

\item{reg.model}{Regression model used to estimate the statistic. The default is Poisson regression with Negative Binomial regression as alternative.}

\item{wt.type}{Which population to use for calculating the 'Overall' Excess estimate as weighted average of the the age-specific Excess estimate.}

\item{save}{whether to automatically save the output as a CSV file.}

\item{save.plot}{whether to produce volcano plot and save it as a plotly object in an HTML file.}
}
\value{
A table containing the ENE statistic (per 100,000 person-years) for each condition and agegroup.
}
\description{
This function uses Poisson or Negative Binomial regression to estimate the Excess Number of Events (ENE) per 100,000 person-years. Agegroup-specific and Overall ENE statistic is calculated for each condition.
